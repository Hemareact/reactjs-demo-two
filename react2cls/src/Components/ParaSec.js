                A power system designer can use HOMER to provide an important overview that compares the cost and feasibility of different configurations
and evaluate the technical performance of the power system
A hybrid system is an electricity generation system, based on the integration of various energy sources (such as photo voltaics, wind turbines, small hydro power or diesel generators)
Hybrid configurations can potentially deliver improved performance and better economic values for a given electrification situation.
Among the various energy modeling software available, the capabilities provided by the HOMER software is the best option for modeling and investigating various hybrid systems. The program first runs an hourly simulation of all possible configurations of system types.
